# RealTimeEmotionDetectionAndSuggestion
In this project i have implemented real time emotion detection using deepFace library in python on google colab and based on the feedback provided it will give some suggestion. The suggestion mechanism is simple and just contain pictures in a folder that i want to suggest based on the feedback. The feedback is also recorded in sqlite. The code was written on google colab so it has to be open there and the neccessary files that are required in this code shall also be imported there
